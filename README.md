Are you tired of cycling to your destination only to find that the nearest bike rack isnâ€™t secure or is too far away from where you want to be?  Look no further than RACKED, the ultimate tool for cycling enthusiasts and commuters. With our app, users can easily locate and access bike racks in their city by simply entering their location or browsing a map. 


Each bike rack on RACKED has a picture so you know exactly where you are going, and exactly what to expect. RACKED even provides ratings based on safety, security, and nearby amenities, so users can make informed decisions about where to park their bike. Plus, our community of users can contribute to the database by uploading pictures and information about new or previously unlisted bike racks. 

Make cycling a more convenient and accessible mode of transportation with RACKED.

RACKED will be a mobile application with simple user submitted content similar to waze. Users will be able to take or upload a photo and tag the location of bike racks. In addition to the rack being geo-tagged, the user will be able to input information about the bike rack such as location safety, rack security, and rack size. The user will also be able to indicate nearby amenities such as bathrooms, water fountains, restaurants or playgrounds. Using Google Maps API, users will also be able to navigate to the rack of their choice.

This app is built using Java, Spring, H2 and mySQL with REACT and Leaflet maps for the front-end.
